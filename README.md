A terrible distaster is on the horizon!! All our computer systems are only using 2 digit date format, so when the date reaches 01/01/2000, all our computers are going to think it's 1900!! Planes will fall from the sky, trains will start going backwards, and every new tin of beans is going to immediately be 100 years out of date. You need to write a function that takes any date from 01 Jan 1970 up to today's date in 2 digit year format (01/01/70) and returns the correct date in 4 digit format. The fate of the world lies with you, but no pressure.

EXAMPLES:

01/01/70 ==> 01/01/1970

12/09/04 ==> 12/09/2004

15/04/19 ==> 15/04/2019

Good luck!
